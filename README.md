### Project Structure 🏗️

The project follows a modular structure that separates different functionalities of the application into distinct sections. The directory structure is as follows:

```plaintext
.
├── src/                   # This directory contains all the application source code.
│   ├── App.tsx            # The entry point of the application.
│   ├── api/               # This directory contains all the API calls used in the application.
│   ├── components/        # This directory contains reusable components.
│   ├── navigation/        # This directory contains all navigation-related code.
│   ├── screens/           # This directory contains code for individual screens of the application.
│   ├── styles/            # This directory contains all the stylesheets or style-related code.
│   └── utils/             # This directory contains utility functions.
├── __tests__/             # This directory contains all the tests for the application.
├── android/               # This directory contains platform-specific code and configurations for Android.
├── ios/                   # This directory contains platform-specific code and configurations for iOS.
├── babel.config.js        # This file contains the configuration for Babel.
└── tsconfig.json          # This file contains the configuration for TypeScript.
